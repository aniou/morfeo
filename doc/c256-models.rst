    ∗ The AS2560 and GEN-X models support an additional 1024x768 text and graphics mode.
    ∗ The GEN-X can have two CPUs -- a 14MHz 65816 and a 68K family, 486 family, RISC-V, etc.
    ∗ Each additional CPU in the GEN-X has its own private 4MB of SYSTEM RAM and 4MB of flash.
    ∗ The AS2560X is essentially a GEN-X with the 65816 CPU and it's private RAM removed.
    ∗ The EXP-C100-ESID expansion card adds 10/100 Ethernet and two SID sockets to a U, U+, or FMX.
    ∗ The SNES/NES Joystick Adapter Box for the C256 Foenix FMX converts the two ATARI ports to 2x NES or SNES ports.
    ∗ The SNES/NES Joystick Adapter Box for the C256 Foenix U/U+ converts the two ATARI ports to 4x NES or SNES ports.
    ∗ The EXP-C200-EVID expansion card adds 10/100 Ethernet and a second DVI port (text-modes only) to a U, U+, or FMX.
    ∗ The 8MB of system RAM on the GEN-X is local to the 65816; the additional 16MB of DRAM is available to all CPUs.
    ∗ The 2nd 9-pin RS232 port on the FMX is available on an internal Intel compatible header.
